An amazing tool on linux, hydra, allows you to try multiple passwords per username during a bruteforce attack, but what if you are trying a bruteforce attack on a webform that locks you out when you get the password wrongly after a few tries for a single username and the best way to fix that is by trying the correct username and password combination interchangably with the username whose password you do not know?

Let us analyze this together, you are trying to guess passwords to a single username, and you have your password list which you will insert in the array, "myPassword" in this code. The username you are trying to guess the passwords for is 'admin', and the username whose password you know is 'think'. This python script generate a bash script that you can copy ad run in your terminal. The bash script first tries the username 'think' with the correct password '123' and then tries username 'admin' with a password from the myPasssword array. After trying one password for usrername 'admin', it tries the username 'think' and correct password '123' and by proving the correct username and password combination, the webform is reset and the next 'admin' and unknown password combination can be made again.
